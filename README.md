## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first ever react project, it was a big challenge, finding different ways to do something that i already have knowledge to do with vanillar JavaScript, however, I enjoyed every bit of the challenge, and I cannot quantify howmuch I learned from this project.

### Continued development

The current version of this project does not have sound form validation for the input fields in step 1, among some other minor styling that didnt meet my preference, but I think it is good enough to bu published, with time, I'll revisit this project and put everything in order.
